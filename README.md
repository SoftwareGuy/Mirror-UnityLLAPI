# Mirror-UnityLLAPI
The removed Unity Low Level API (LLAPI) transport files for [Mirror Networking](http://github.com/vis2k/Mirror).

May or may not be compatible with latest Mirror. 

**I offer no support for this transport.** You should really consider using Ignorance or LiteNet for Mirror instead.

That is all.
